    <h2>My Interests</h2>
    <h3>Travelling</h3>
    <p>
        I love to travel. I love long journey, long road trips. I went to various places in India. I travel to northern , to eastern, to southern, 
        and to western parts of India. Specifically, I went to temples for dashan like all the <span>"11 Jyotirling" </span>
        with my family. My family is very much indulged in praying. And with this, we went almost every year for a few days trip.
        It is really interesting to travel to new places and see the beauty around. I love mountaineous places like hill stations where 
        there are glaciers. That damn view is so peaceful like you are in heaven, all around surrounded with mountains. It is a different feeling 
        to be at such a place. And I look forward to more such trips with my love and my close ones.

    <h3>Music</h3>
    <p>
        Music is something which calms your mind. Takes you to another moment. Songs are really a major part of life.
        Without them, our life is so silent and emotionless. I like to listen slow and romantic songs while listening 
        to pop songs make me dance. I like to sing songs too. My friends said that I have a nice voice and tone while singing a song. 
        If I love a song I listen it on a loop like madly till then its essence and its every word pour in my heart. 
        Mostly I listen to Hindi songs and my favourites are 90s old songs, but I listen to English songs too if someone makes me to sing it 
        and if it comes to my suggestions but not so oftenly.

        I am glad to tell about all this. In this page I show the parallax effect, that is the four images have the parallax effect. 
        The images are static while the page is moving. Having a look at it makes the person astonished. Even when I first saw it, 
        it makes me curious to know about it. It creates amazing design and styling in the webpage and attracts the person.
    </p>
    <h3>Thanks for giving a look at it!</h3>
