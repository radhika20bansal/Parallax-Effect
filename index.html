    <h2>My Interests</h2>
    <h3>Travelling</h3>
    <p>
        I love to travel. I love long journey, long road trips. I went to various places in India. I travel to northern , to eastern, to southern, 
        and to western parts of India. Specifically, I went to temples for dashan like all the <span>"11 Jyotirling" </span>
        with my family. My family is very much indulged in praying. And with this, we went almost every year for a few days trip.
        It is really interesting to travel to new places and see the beauty around. I love mountaineous places like hill stations where 
        there are glaciers. That damn view is so peaceful like you are in heaven, all around surrounded with mountains. It is a different feeling 
        to be at such a place. And I look forward to more such trips with my love and my close ones.

             but for LIFE not to Escape US ”

    <h3>Music</h3>
    <p>
        Music is something which calms your mind. Takes you to another moment. Songs are really a major part of life.
        Without them, our life is so silent and emotionless. I like to listen slow and romantic songs while listening 
        to pop songs make me dance. I like to sing songs too. My friends said that I have a nice voice and tone while singing a song. 
        If I love a song I listen it on a loop like madly till then its essence and its every word pour in my heart. 
        Mostly I listen to Hindi songs and my favourites are 90s old songs, but I listen to English songs too if someone makes me to sing it 
        and if it comes to my suggestions but not so oftenly. 
    </p>
    <div id="image3">
        <p class="quote"> “ The music is not in the notes, <br>
           but in the silence between ! ”
        </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Drawing and Painting</h3>
    <p>
        Drawing and painting is reflection of ones creativity. What are their perspective towards anything can be easily 
        predicted through their paintings. What their thoughts about can be clearly depicted in the paintings. I am quite 
        interested in drawing or sketching perticularly. Frankly, I was not a art fond person and even I didn't like drawing at all.
        At my school times, I have always completed my drawing file by making the drawings from others and show them to the teacher.
        But later on, I tried to paint on my sketch book and it results in the best thing I have ever made with brush. And then I continue it and 
        learn to paint well. My mother said if I am in the mood to do anything I will do it anyhow, But if doesn't no one can make me forced to do that work.
        And then I realize I can paint well too. I have made portraits and some abstract arts and post them onto my instagram account. 
        I like to view new painting techniques and styles and often looked at.

        <p class="quotes"> “ There's no retirement for an artist, 
            it's your way of living so there's no end to it . ”

        I am glad to tell about all this. In this page I show the parallax effect, that is the four images have the parallax effect. 
        The images are static while the page is moving. Having a look at it makes the person astonished. Even when I first saw it, 
        it makes me curious to know about it. It creates amazing design and styling in the webpage and attracts the person.
    </p>
    <h3>Thanks for giving a look at it!</h3>
